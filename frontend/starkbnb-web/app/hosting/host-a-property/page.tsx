            StarkBnB takes advantage of Blockchain Technology and builds on Starknet (and other chains soon)
            to serve our users a web app where they can put up their property for rentals, but anonymously.
            <br />
            We address the privacy breaches that are common with web 2 by taking advantage of Starknet, as it
            aligns with the goal of the organization behind us - Prometheus.
            <br />
            More will be added/removed from this text to make it better later
        </p>
